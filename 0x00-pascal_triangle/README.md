# Pascal's Triangle

## Overview

This module contains a function called `pascal_triangle` that generates Pascal's triangle for a given number of rows.

## Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers constructed by adding the two numbers above to create the next number in the row. For example, the first three rows of Pascal's triangle are:
```
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]

```


## Functionality

The code defines a function called `pascal_triangle` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of lists of integers representing the first `n` rows of Pascal's triangle.

### Implementation Details

The function iterates over the number of rows and for each row, it iterates over the number of elements in the row. For each element, it adds the two elements above it to get the value of the current element.

## Concepts Covered

This code covers the following concepts:

- **Recursion:** The `pascal_triangle` function is a recursive function, meaning that it calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
- **List comprehensions:** The code uses list comprehensions to concisely create lists of numbers.
- **Iterators:** The code uses iterators to loop through the rows and elements of Pascal's triangle.
